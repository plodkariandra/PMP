Eventually, as he tries to stomp it into the ground, he inadvertently causes a large crack to form in the ice that extends for miles before setting off a large avalanche which nearly crushes him. He barely escapes but finds himself getting stepped on by a herd of prehistoric animals migrating south in order to escape the forthcoming ice age.

Manny is annoyed by Sid\'s outgoing demeanor and wishes to migrate on his own, but Sid nonetheless continues to follow Manny.',
